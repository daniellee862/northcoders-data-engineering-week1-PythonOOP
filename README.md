## Instructions

This sprint is designed to build on your knowledge of OOP and classes. You have been provided a list of md files containing instructions for each kata. There is a recommended running order that we would like you to follow. The final three katas are larger and should be worked on last.

Create a src and test folder for your work. There should be a new Python file and a new test file per kata.

## üí°Remember to complete each task with full TDD.üí°

# Section One:

## OOP Tasks

## 1. üè´ Build a Northcoder üè´

Create a Class of Northcoder, this class should have the following properties:

-   `name`
-   `location`
-   `course`
-   `graduation_date`

```
alex = Northcoder('Alex', 'Stockport', 'Software Engineering', 'March 2020')
```

Your Northcoder should have the following methods:

-   `greet`

```py
alex.greet('Joe') # Should return 'Hello Joe, my name is Alex'
```

-   `alumni`

```py
alex.alumni() # Should return True as Alex's graduation date has passed.
```

---

## 2. üéÆ High Scores üéÆ

---

You've built a great game for all your friends to play but you need a leader board. How else will you prove that you're the best?

-   Create a high score table class that takes one argument to control a `limit` property.

-   Your class should hold a `scores` property that returns a list. All scores in the list should be returned in descending order.

```py
high_scores = HighScoreTable(3)
high_scores.scores == [] # Should return True
high_scores.limit # Should return 3
```

-   Add an `update` method to update the scores list with a **dictionary** containing the name of the player and their score.

```py
high_scores.update({'player':'Cat', 'score':95})
high_scores.update({'player':'Verity', 'score':150})
high_scores.scores # Should return [{'player':'Verity', 'score':150},{'player':'Cat', 'score':95}] as the scores are in descending order
```

-   The `update` method should not allow more scores to be added if the `limit` has been reached. If the `limit` has been reached, and the score passed to the `update` method is larger than any of the stored scores, the new high score should be stored.

-   Add a method to return the `average_score` of all the high scores.

-   Add a method that returns the `highest_scorer` in the table.

-   Add a method that returns the `lowest_scorer` in the table.

-   Add a method to `reset` the scores table to remove all high scores.

```py
high_scores.scores # Would return [{'player':'Verity', 'score':150},{'player':'Cat', 'score':95}]
high_scores.reset()
high_scores.scores # After reset method should return []
```

## 3. üëª Build a Ghost üëª

Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, collectively known as the Ghost Gang, are a quartet of characters from the Pac-Man video game franchise. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_(Pac-Man) In this exercise you will create a base class of a Ghost that can be extended to create the Ghost Gang.

-   Create a class of Ghost with the following properties :`name`, `speed` and `colour`

```py
ghost = Ghost('Ducky', 3, 'yellow')
ghost.name # Would return 'Ducky'
ghost.colour # Would return 'yellow'
```

-   Each Ghost also needs a property of `is_scared`. This property will default to False.

```py
ghost.is_scared # Would return False
```

-   When Pac Man eats a fruit, the Ghosts become scared and can be eaten. Add a method called `can_be_eaten`. This method should return `True` if the Ghosts are scared, or `False` if they are not.

```py
mack = Ghost('Mack', 9, 'grey')
mack.colour # Should return 'grey'
mack.is_scared # Should return False
mack.can_be_eaten() # Should return False
```

-   If the Ghosts are scared, their `colour` will change to blue. If a Ghost is blue, they can also be eaten. Create a method called `frighten` to control this change.

```py
mack.is_scared # Should return False
mack.can_be_eaten() # Should return False

mack.frighten()
mack.is_scared # Should return True
mack.can_be_eaten() # Should return True
mack.colour # Should return 'blue'
```

-   As Pac Man's lives reduce, each ghost's `speed` is increased by 10%. Create a method called `speed_up` that updates the ghost's speed with each invocation.

```py
jersey = Ghost('Jersey', 3, 'white')
jersey.speed_up()
jersey.speed # Should return 3.3
jersey.speed_up()
jersey.speed # Should return 3.63
jersey.speed_up()
jersey.speed # Should return 3.993
```

In the original Pac Man game, the four ghosts had set names and colours. Extend your Ghost class for all four ghosts.

-   Blinky is red and has a speed of 3,
-   Pinky is pink and has a speed of 2,
-   Inky is cyan and has a speed of 4,
-   Clyde is yellow and has a speed of 1.

```py
blinky = Blinky('Blinky', 3,'red')
blinky.colour # Should return 'red'

blinky.frighten()
blinky.colour # Should return 'blue'
blinky.is_scared # Should return True
blinky.can_be_eaten # Should return True
```

All of your class extensions should still have access to the original methods and should show the expected behaviour. Make sure to test your extensions thoroughly.

## 4. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Object Orientated Piracy üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

---

Every ship needs a Captain, create a Class with the following properties:

-   `name`
-   `nickname`
-   `crew_size`
-   `catchphrase`

```py
david = Captain('David', 'General Bartlett', 10, 'I will not say arr')
david.name # Would return 'David'
david.nickname # Would return 'General Bartlett'
david.crew_size # Would return 10
david.catchphrase # Would return 'I will not say arr'
```

As a Captain of a small pirate crew that needs help to identify ships with a heavy booty on board. The problem is, ships are laden with crews, cannons and gold. How can we tell if a ship is worth plundering?

Create a standard Ship Class that takes two arguments:

-   `draft` - an estimate of the ship's weight based on how low it is in the water.
-   `captain`- Should be an instance of a Captain class.

```py
hms_boaty = Ship(20, david)
hms_boaty.draft # Should return 20
hms_boaty.crew # Should return the crew_size present on the Captain class
```

Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object based on their observations. Each shipmate adds 1.5 units to the ship draft.

-   Add a method called `worth_it`. This method should remove the weight of the crew from the draft. If the draft is more than 20 the method should return True, else return False.

```py
hms_boaty.worth_it() # Should return False
```

---

## 5. üìä Vectors üìä

Create a Vector Class that takes a list of integers.

```py
list_one = Vector([1,2,3])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
```

Your class should have the following methods:

-   `add` Should return a **new Vector**

```py
list_one = Vector([1,2,3])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
list_one.add(list_two) # Should return Vector([3,5,7])
```

-   `subtract` Should return a **new Vector**

```py
list_one = Vector([1,2,3])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
list_one.subtract(list_two) # Should return Vector([-1,-1,-1])
```

-   `dot` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product

```py
list_one = Vector([1,2,3])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
list_one.dot(list_two) # Should return (1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4) = 20
```

-   `is_equal` should check whether or not the two vector lengths are equal.

```py
list_one = Vector([1,2,3])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
list_one.is_equal(list_two) # Should return True

list_one = Vector([1,2,3,5])
list_two = Vector([2,3,4])
list_one.is_equal(list_two) # Should return False
```

If you try to `add`, `subtract` or `dot` two vectors with different lengths your Class should throw an exception.

## 6. üè¶ Banking App üè¶

You are building a mobile banking app for a new tech startup! The CTO of the company wants you to design a `User` class that will have various features enabling a user to interact with their new account.

The CTO's specification for the `User` class is detailed below.

It must have a `current_balance` property, which will be a **float** representing amount of pounds, starting at `0.00`:

```py
joes_account = User();
joes_account.current_balance # Should return 0.00
```

It must have a `pots` property, which will be an **empty dictionary** that will store pots for saving money for specific things.

```py
joes_account = User();
joes_account.pots # Should return {};
```

It must have a `deposit_money` method which will update the the `current_balance` in pounds:

```py
joes_account = User();
joes_account.deposit_money(10.56)
joes_account.current_balance # Should return 10.56
joes_account.deposit_money(2.3)
joes_account.current_balance # Should return 12.86
```

It must have a `create_new_pot` method which will add a new property to the `pots` property with a key for the type of the pot being created and an object containing the `pot_balance`:

```py
joes_account = User();
joes_account.pots # Should return {}

joes_account.createNewPot('holiday')
joes_account.pots['holiday'] # Should return {'pot_balance': 0}

joes_account.createNewPot('mortgage_deposit')
joes_account.pots['mortgage_deposit'] # Should return {pot_balance: 0}

joes_account.pots # Should return {'holiday' : {'pot_balance':0},'mortgage_deposit':{'pot_balance':0}}
```

It must have an `add_to_pot` method which will add money to the `pot_balance` of a given pot:

```py
joes_account = User();
joes_account.pots # Would return an empty dictionary

joes_account.create_new_pot('holiday');
joes_account.add_to_pot('holiday', 10);
joes_account.pots['holiday'] # Should return { pot_balance: 10 }

joes_account.add_to_pot('holiday', 30);
joes_account.pots['holiday'] # Should return { potBalance: 40 }

```

It must have a `transfer_to_pot` method which will transfer money from the `current_balance` to the `pot_balance`. If there is **insufficient money** in the `current_balance` then the function should have no effect on the current User.

```py
joes_account = new User();
joes_account.deposit_money(10.56)
joes_account.current_balance # Should return 10.56

joes_account.create_new_pot('holiday')
joes_account.add_to_pot('holiday', 10)
joes_account.transfer_to_pot('holiday', 5.03)

joes_account.currentBalance # Should return 5.53
joes_account.pots['holiday'] # Should return { potBalance: 15.03 }

joes_account.transfer_to_pot('holiday', 6.50) /* insufficient funds */
joes_account.currentBalance # Should return 5.53
joes_account.pots['holiday'] # Should return { potBalance: 15.03 }

```

## 7. üõó Lift me up üõó

You are designing a lift for a swanky new apartment in Manchester. You decide to go for an object-oriented approach, with a `Lift` class that can generate lift instances with certain useful properties and methods to model the behaviour of the lift.

The site manager's specification for the `Lift` class is detailed below. Be **sure to write tests** for each aspect of behaviour you want from the class.

Your lift should have a `max_capacity` property, which will be a **number** representing the total weight (in kg) that the lift can hold, which will be passed to the `class` when it it invoked.

```py
testLift = Lift(100)
testLift.maxCapacity # Should return 100
```

Your lift should have a `passengers` property, which will **initially be an empty list**, holding each passenger in the lift.

```py
testLift = Lift(100)
testLift.passengers # Should return []
```

Your lift should have a `floors_count` property, which will be passed to the `class` when it it invoked.

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.floorsCount # Should return 3
```

Your lift should have a `current_floor` property which will be intialised at `0`

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.currentFloor # Should return 0
```

Create a Passenger class with the following properties `name`, `weight`

```py
bob = Passenger('Bob',12)
```

Your lift should have an `add_passenger` method can update the `passengers` property with a Passenger class. If the `max_weight` is exceeded, no more Passengers can be added to the lift.

```py
bob = Passenger('Bob',12)
testLift = Lift(100, 3)

testLift.passengers # Should return []
testLift.add_passenger(bob)
testLift.passengers # Should return [bob]
```

Your lift should have a `find_total_weight` method that can find the total weight of the passengers in the lift's passengers property

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
bob = Passenger('Bob',12)
testLift.add_passenger(bob)
testLift.find_total_weight() # Should return 12
```

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
alex = Passenger('Alex', 12)
cat = Passenger('Cat',9)
mitch = Passenger('Mitch',11)
testLift.add_passenger(Cat)
testLift.add_passenger(alex)
testLift.find_total_weight() # Should return 21
testLift.add_passenger(mitch)
testLift.find_total_weight() # Should return 32
```

Your lift should have a `remove_passenger` method that updates the `passengers` property and return value from `find_total_weight`

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
alex = Passenger('Alex', 12)
cat = Passenger('Cat',9)

testLift.add_passenger(Cat)
testLift.add_passenger(alex)
testLift.find_total_weight() # Should return 21
testLift.remove_passenger(cat)
testLift.find_total_weight() # Should return 12
```

Your lift should have a `move` method that will either move the lift up or down a floor. However, the method should return a warning message if you try to go up from the top floor or if you try to go below the ground floor (floor `0`). See below:

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.move('up')
testLift.current_floor # Should return 1
```

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 1
testLift.currentFloor # Should return 1
```

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 1
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 2
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 3
testLift.move('up') # Should return 'You are already on the top floor!'
```

```py
testLift = Lift(100, 3)
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 1
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 2
testLift.move('up') # Now at floor 3
testLift.move("down") # Now at floor 2
testLift.currentFloor # Should return 2
```

## 8. ü§ñMy new robot ü§ñ

Write a Robot class that will return robot instances.

It must have a `name` property, which will be a string representing the name of the robot.

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.name # Should return 'R2D2'
```

It must have a `direction` property, which will be a string representing the current direction the robot instance is facing: it can be either 'N' for facing north, 'E' for East, 'S' for South and 'W' for west. The direction will be intialised at'N' - i.e. the robot starts facing north

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.direction # Should return 'N' <-- initially the robot is facing North
```

It must have a `word_list` property, containing a unique list of all the words the Robot can understand. It will be initialised as an empty list in the beginning when the instance is first created

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.wordList # Should return []
```

It must have a `position` property, which is an list of 2 numbers representing the position of the robot. The first number in the position list represents "how far to the right" the robot is. The second number in the position list represents "how far up the robot is"

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.position # Should return [0, 0] <-- robot's initial starting position
```

It must have an `add_words` method - this function will add words on to the `word_list` property. This method can take any number of string arguments.

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.add_words('ball', 'code', 'apple')
testRobot.word_list # Should return ['ball','code','apple']

testRobot.addWords('sky')
testRobot.wordList # Should return ['ball','code','apple','sky']
```

The `word_list` must contain unique words so if someone attempts to add the same word twice it won't get added to the wordList.

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.add_words('apple', 'banana', 'kiwi')
testRobot.add_words('banana', 'kiwi')

testRobot.wordList # Should return ['apple','banana', 'kiwi'] <-- 'banana' only stored once
```

It must have a `move_horizontally` method and a `move_vertically` method which will update the first number in the position list and the second number in the position list, respectively.

Note: the robot's current position doesn't affect the `move_horizontally` and `move_vertically` functionality i.e. the robot can move up vertically even if it is facing south.

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.position # Should return [0, 0]

testRobot.move_horizontally(10) // moves right 10 units
testRobot.position # Should return [10, 0]

testRobot.move_vertically(60) // moves up 60 units
testRobot.position # Should return [10, 60]
```

It must have a `rotate` method which takes a number indicating the number of 90 degree turns clockwise the robot should make so to end up facing a new direction. The effect of `rotate` should be up to update the `direction` property with the correct value of either 'N', 'E', 'S' or 'W'.

```py
testRobot = Robot('R2D2')
testRobot.direction // initially 'N' (facing north)

testRobot.rotate(1)
testRobot.direction # Should return 'E' now facing East

testRobot.rotate(2)
testRobot.direction # Should return 'w' now facing West (equivalent to moving 180 degrees clockwise starting at East)
```

# Section Two

## CLI Mini App

You'll be making a simple console app using the data provided that users can interact with (just try to keep it relatively simple).

Start off with the core functionality of the console app to get it working, and then think about additional features you can add. Building a CLI app in Python shouldn't need any external packages (even though there are some). There are some great built in functions to help you do this.

Take a look at the documentation for:

```
input()
```

-   [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input)
-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)
-   [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-input-function/)

## Data

---

-   You have been provided with a JSON file that contains a list of people and equipment, with each having other additional information. Feel free to add to and/or change the data for your adventure purposes, make sure to keep it in JSON format!

_Idea_

-   Create a choose your own adventure console game, where the user can interact with NPCs, travel through rooms, use equipment. You could include functionality for a shop, battling, finding treasures.
